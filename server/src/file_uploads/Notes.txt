File upload -> Media manager

Discuss at next meeting:
	For file upload:
		Need to make it possible for @admin_login_required for upload page
	Other things:
		Need a delete history option (for entire history path rather than a singular page)
		Not sure if this is only due to local testing, but we need to make the "password breached" message when a user logs in to not display
